						during Christmas? Well, let me tell you, A little wiener dog named Billie certainly
						has. He has always been curious about the Christmas traditions. He was woken early on
						Christmas Eve morning by a weird sound. He looked up and saw the ghost of
						Christmas past, which happened to be his old best friend Charlie.</b>

						Billie asked why the gingerbread house was a Christmas tradition. Charlie then proceeded
						to explain that the first gingerbread recipe came from Grease in 2400 B.C and that Chinese
						recipes developed in the 10th century, after this Europeans developed their recipe and
						they decided to make them into shapes. Queen Elizabeth was the first one to come up with the
						idea of decorating the gingerbread cookies.</b></p>
